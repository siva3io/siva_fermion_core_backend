## Invnetory Orders

### About ASN
Advanced shipping notice (ASN) is a document that provides detailed information about a pending delivery. The purpose of an ASN is to notify the customer when shipping occurs and provide physical characteristics about the shipment so the customer can be prepared to accept delivery.

### About GRN
Goods Receipt Note or GRN is a document that acknowledges that the delivery has been executed successfully by the seller to the customer. And this receipt conveys that the goods have been delivered without any forthcomings like damage, exposed packaging or wrong product.

### Inventory Adjustments
You adjust inventory in a store when the quantity of items in a location is not the same as the quantity of items recorded. This can occur for a number of reasons. For example, if products in a store are damaged, the amount of inventory available must be adjusted to reflect that situation.

Inventory Adjustments can be used to modify the value and/or quantity of stock in your business. For example, if you have just discovered that you need to change the quantity of items on hand, then this is a possible method you can explore.
