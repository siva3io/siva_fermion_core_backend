Here are some of the things that you can do:
Calculate Shipping Rates with our Rate Calculator You can calculate shipping rates quickly according to your Aramex rate sheet, and you can provide that info to your visitors.
Schedule a Pickup When preparing a shipment, you can request an Aramex courier to collect one or more shipments for delivery to the consignee. The request is processed by our nearest Ground Operations Team, and the courier calls to confirm the pickup time. During pickup, Aramex courier scans the barcode on the shipment label and verifies the destination of each shipment.
Create Shipment Create a shipment or empower your customers to create shipments on the go, and you get an air waybill number which your customers can use to track their shipments.
Print label After you prepare a shipment, download the shipment label, print it, and then attach it to the shipment box. Then, you need to submit the shipments to an Aramex outlet.
Track Shipment After you prepare a shipment (regular or return), the extension generates a unique air waybill (AWB) number. Use the AWB number to track the current shipment location and history in the extension. The consignee receives the AWB number by email and can use it to track the shipment at the Aramex website or in the Aramex Eunimart App.
Returns If the consignee decides to return the shipment, you need to prepare a return shipment. You can also request an Aramex courier to pick up the shipment form the consignee and deliver it back to your store.
Additional Features
To help with your returns, we let you do Reverse Pickup and from the same page you can print labels, track shipments, and schedule pickups.
